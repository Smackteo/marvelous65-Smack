This keyboard is inspired by luantty2's Candy BLE (https://github.com/luantty2/nRF52840-instruction). When I first saw that I was like "Beautiful! Marvelous!" but that would be nice to make that in 65%. So With no basic knowledge of electronic I brave myself to learn Kicad with the guide of https://wiki.ai03.com/books/pcb-design/page/pcb-guide-part-1---preparations. Basically this is just an nrfmicro 1.4 by Joric embedded in PCB.
I also learn some basic Fusion 360 to make a keyboard case and plate. Since my printer is ender 3 pro, I have to split everything in two. You might notice there is a litle gap in the keyboard, that is where I split my plate.

This is my first PCB and I make a lot of stupid design decision, I will share it the PCB case and plate design once I done with the revison. I plan to make it multi layout with split backspace, 6.5u spacebar and split space.
with this small board actually it makes sense with split spacebar cause I need more modifier (2 Fn). But if this is gonna be multi layout there will be no hotswap. maybe i will make it two version. The split spacebar is 2u, 1.25 and 2.75u. I choose 2u rather than 2.25 because I consider the keycap availability.

When I finish designing this, I realize I am not he first one to design this, there is someone in zfrontier forum already done it, it is called Rainbow65, check it out https://www.zfrontier.com/app/flow/e1rpMAd9Nz75.
and there is someone planning an IC for similar layout and feature. 

Anyway here is the photos of me making this board https://imgur.com/gallery/9tkokVy
